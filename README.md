## Capstone 1 on Darey.io

* I created a new repo in Github 
#### _I don't have a screenshot of this, I didn't know I was meant to be taking screenshot of my every step_
* I created the 4 initial pages and added random content using the MD lang I learnt

![Step 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c088e8d-a70d-45c3-89a8-9b1236a41c16)

* Next I push to main

![Step 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d647ab07-6fe7-413b-a27a-e49d7d623f4b)

* Next I created, reviewed and merged PR from Morgan - Add-book-review
_again, I don't have live pictures of this but this should do_

![Step 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45e27c71-3fc1-4c4d-a66e-158b08dfd259)


* Next I create the Jamie branch and edit events page. The next picture would show the branches created in my local repo and the branches in Github
